<p>This book is written by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy and is a classic of realistic novels. <br>
  This book reflects the living conditions in Russia at that time and the tragic life of Anna, <br>
   the main character in the book. The opening sentence, "Happy families are all similar, <br>
    but unhappy families are each unhappy in their own way" is the most classic in the book.</p>
